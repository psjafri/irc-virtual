## Information regarding this repository
Hi stranger!
Maybe there won't be a lot of people who will understand this repository.
It will be used as a backup/to share ideas, and everything between the students who have the same subject.
In this repository, we will use PowerShell that we use in the labs, and the purpose is to make it easier for someone else who has the same task to just copy and paste it to the server, and run it line by line.

## Want to help and collaborate!
If you are interested in making a contribution, you are welcome to do so.
You can clone this repo, edit it, and then make a pull request, and I will check it.

I just hope this repository will help us to have a better understanding of the subject.
